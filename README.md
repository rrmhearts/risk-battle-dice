# Risk Battle Dice

This code reveals Risk battle probabilities for my personal amusement. Use these figures at your own *Risk*.

**Note:** This branch, `balanced-blitz` is not correct and is still **Under Construction**. Need to convert [https://github.com/smgstudio/risk-dice](https://github.com/smgstudio/risk-dice).

## Getting Started

pip install matplotlib
python battle.py
```

## Results

**NOT finished, do not use.**
